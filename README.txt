Hoyas in Space

In this app, we see Jack the Bulldog in space! The objective is to obtain as many basketballs as possible. The more basketballs you get, the higher your score is. However, for every basketball you let pass by, you lose points as well.

The movement in this game is different than other games. In space, there is pure inertia, so gravity is not acting upon the dog’s movement. The user can either touch above the dog or below the dog and that is where the dog will go, so act fast. Jack the Bulldog has six enemies (Marquette, Creighton, Villanova, Syracuse, SNAPS, and a Rat) that come his way that he must avoid in order to get the highest score. The cheat code “hoyasaxa” will increase his movement speed from 10 to 20.
